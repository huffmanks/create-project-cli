# cpr-cli âš¡

## A lightning-fast project creator

This is a command-line tool (CLI) that helps you bootstrap new projects in a flash!

### Features:

- Curated starter packages and components to accelerate development.
- Interactive prompts to customize your project.

```sh
npx cpr-cli@latest
```

### Roadmap

1. [ ] **Command-Line Arguments:** Skip prompts by providing options directly in the terminal command. For example, cpr-cli --name my-project would create a project named "my-project" without prompting you for a name. (arg package)
2. [ ] **Automatic package manager detection:** Detect your preferred package manager and use it to install project dependencies.
